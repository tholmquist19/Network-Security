This lab has two files that need to be run.  In order to run the part 1 of the lab all you need to do is run the command "./lab3-part1.py 128".  This should print out both public and private keys, the message before and after encryption, and then the message after decryption. Then for part 2 all that needs to be done is run the command "./lab3-part2.py".  This will print out the public key, the private key, the encrypted message, and the message after it has been decrypted.
