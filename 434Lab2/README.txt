Before running this code you must run the command "sudo iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m owner ! --uid-owner root --dport 80 -j DNAT --to :8080" in the command line.  Once that is run all that needs to be dun is run the bahs script called "runlab2.sh" then open up an http website for example http://httpforever.com/ and then the website should load and the packets can be captured in the terminal.
