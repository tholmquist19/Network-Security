This program is designed to show the flows of each GC event that occurs in a session through reading in packets from a .pcap file.  In order to run this program you must type "sudo ./Lab6.py <fileName>" with file name being the pcap file you would like to have analyzed.  Once ran the program will output each stream of TTLs for a hijacked flow in an array format and then the number of hijacked flows.  This program also works for GFW events but the array size will be one too large so you will have to ignore the last index of the array in GFW events.
