in order to run this lab you must first run lab9.py with sudo permissions. after that you run the lab9_2.py with the path to the file you want to test as the command line argument while in the same directory you ran lab9.py in and it will output what page that user went to for example 'sudo ./lab9_2.py "degree_options/sam.pcap"'. If it prints a blank line then run lab9.py again and test the .pcap file again since connections can vary (sam likes to be difficult).
